Why Data Structures?
- They are essential ingredients


Abstract Data Type(ADT) vs. Data Structures

Complexity Analysis
- How much time ?
- How much sapce ?

Big-O Notation
- gives an upper bound of the Complexity in the `worst` case, helping to
quantify performance as the input size becomes `arbitrarily large`.

Dynamic Array 
- can grow and shrink
